Final00_00	Fantasy Bubble
Final00_01	With the matter-of-fact voice of the announcer,
Final00_02	The big, cold screen is like a diversionary pastime between major news stories,
Final00_03	has been temporarily interrupting the broadcast of your disappearance,
Final00_04	No one knows that you have passed away in some distant world.
Final00_05	Even if your friends and family are running around...,
Final00_06	They've been searching for years, but they still haven't heard from you.
Final00_07	As the sun and moon fly by, the stars change,
Final00_08	Eventually, inevitably, people slowly forget you existed,
Final00_09	All that's left is maybe the mention of your name,
Final00_10	A sigh of relief
Final01_00	The arrow returns to the heart.
Final01_01	As in the end of every good story, good things come to those who do good, and evil things come to those who do evil,
Final01_02	Even if, as is customary, the malice that comes to you at the end from the shadows,
Final01_03	Nor will it deter you from returning home.
Final01_04	This journey has been an unexpected interlude for you,
Final01_05	But it will be a warning to you in the future,
Final01_06	The consequences of giving up the life that is before you,
Final01_07	What the end will be.
Final01_08	You shake your head and cast away the heavy thoughts,
Final01_09	To your friends who have fought with you on this journey,
Final01_10	Smile and wave goodbye.
Final01_11	Although the city of brocade is happy, it is better to return home early.
Final01_12	With a hint of excitement, but also with anxiety,
Final01_13	You step once again through the doors of the Temple that are both familiar and strange.
Final01_14	This time ahead awaits you,
Final01_15	would be a warm home,
Final01_16	Or will it be another new adventure?
Final02_00	Heart of the White Head
Final02_01	You woke up with a slap the one before you who was cowering in illusion,
Final02_02	The old man who is constantly running away from reality.
Final02_03	The illusory beauty he sought could not free him from his miserable reality,
Final02_04	That is the future to which you refuse to submit,
Final02_05	It's also a mirror that you can't let go of.
Final02_06	Life exists beautifully ,
Final02_07	But it will never come before people who give up lightly.
Final02_08	There is only one thing you have to do,
Final02_09	is to bring back the old man before you,
Final02_10	To renew each other's determination to strive for a better life.
Final02_11	Returning home, no matter how bitter the reality may be,
Final02_12	You will all move forward boldly and write your own lives!
Final02_13	Who says that life is no less?
Final02_14	Flowing water in front of the gate can still be west! Hugh will sing the yellow chicken with white hair.
Final03_00	Seeing the nature and clarifying the heart
Final03_01	The heavenly books are united and invincible,
Final03_02	In the blink of an eye, all of Shu's masters were defeated by you two.
Final03_03	You sweep coldly across the ground, sweeping over your friends who were on the same side as you,
Final03_04	A scattered body,
Final03_05	It is all about the foolishness of the past that speaks to you.
Final03_06	It is "you" who tell yourself ,
Final03_07	Should no longer be limited by foolish benevolence,
Final03_08	Let the power that is in your hands slip away from you.
Final03_09	Look back at the strange yet familiar "you" and smile at each other,
Final03_10	In the future, you two will walk hand in hand,
Final03_11	Create the ideal future that belongs only to "you".
Final03_12	In that split second, you are more certain that you have chosen the right path.
Final03_13	Exactly: The tide comes in on the Qiantang River, and today you know I am me!
Final04_00	Wolf's Ambition.
Final04_01	As the saying goes, "Nine words awaken the wayward, but one word awakens the dreamer.
Final04_02	The "you" who was lying in the pool of blood did say one thing correctly,
Final04_03	Power should not be wasted in vain.
Final04_04	And that is why it should most certainly be used to take more power.
Final04_05	If the so-called future is so ugly, why not let it be forgotten?
Final04_06	Look at this sea of broken spears and broken corpses,
Final04_07	This is the power you have to transform the world.
Final04_08	You will use this power to transform the unreal into a new future,
Final04_09	No one will be able to stop your desires and intentions.
Final04_10	That ideal land that lurks in your heart ,
Final04_11	It is already within reach!
Final05_00	The foothills of the Cang Mountain
Final05_01	Duan Siping and the Nanzhao clans formed a rebel army,
Final05_02	All the way to the capital of Nanzhao, Er City,
Final05_03	Yang Tianyi fled the country without knowing where he was going.
Final05_04	Then Duan Siping became the emperor and founded the Dali state,
Final05_05	Working to improve the lives of the Nanzhao clans,
Final05_06	It created a powerful nation based in southern Yunnan for centuries to come.
Final05_07	As a tribute to Zen Master Jinding's legacy,
Final05_08	Duan Siping built the Temple of Heavenly Dragons in the city and ordered his descendants to worship it for generations.
Final05_09	Hearing the sad news of He Baishao's death,
Final05_10	He Yudie recognizes the mistakes she made in the past,
Final05_11	It was decided to delegate the authority and heavy responsibility of leading the Qingzhai clan to several Qingzhai clansmen.
Final05_12	In addition to being the next head of the Qingzhai clan, He Ziwan,
Final05_13	Finally, she also had the right to pursue freedom.
Final05_14	During her leadership, Qingzhai was the mainstay of support for the Dali state,
Final05_15	Continuously prosperous, they are marching towards a glorious future together with the Dali kingdom.
Final05_16	The two of them viewed this hard-won achievement from the mountains,
Final05_17	Thinking of the heavenly visitor who played an important role in the journey,
Final05_18	Guessing where he would be today?
Final05_19	Will there ever be a day when we will be together again, cutting the candles at the western window?
Final06_00	White Horse Idle Motion
Final06_01	The troubled world is still troubled, but the people of Whitehorse House seem to be unaware of it,
Final06_02	Laughing and toiling, sunrise and sunset.
Final06_03	Even Qi Xiaoer was terrified when she left the school,
Final06_04	In the daytime, she seems stubborn, but in the night, she feels sad.
Final06_05	Fortunately, Li Tan took good care of her and took Qi Xiaoer with him on a trip around the world.
Final06_06	The two of them also stole a letter back from the Dianchang Master and left it behind,
Final06_07	Kneel down and ask her master not to miss her.
Final06_08	Finally, he returned to Whitehorse and settled down to be married for the rest of his life.
Final07_00	the eagle of the snowy mountains
Final07_01	Although Mu House has suffered a devastating coup d'état and has lost many lives,
Final07_02	But as a result of this, they became more united, and there was no longer any factional strife.
Final07_03	Mu House, led by Mu Chu,
Final07_04	Bringing a period of peace and tranquility to the town of Dayan.
Final07_05	And Ade Ake, on the other hand, has not forgotten his ideals after setting up the settlement,
Final07_06	Then he took a boat, crossed to Osawa, and went eastward.
Final07_07	A few years later, the rumor in the town of Dayan went like this.
Final07_08	In the far east of the martial arts world, a foreign traveler with an eagle appeared,
Final07_09	With his superb archery skills, he vanquished the bandits and pacified the troubles.
Final07_10	The name of "The Eagle of Snow Mountain" quickly spread throughout the martial arts world.
Final07_11	Ade Ake, who had survived the cold and the heat, had returned from a long journey,
Final07_12	He was warmly received by the townspeople.
Final07_13	He taught the townspeople and the guards the art of taming eagles,
Final07_14	It has made Dayan a beautiful town where Confucianism and eagle hunting traditions are blended.
Final07_15	Afterwards, every time he came to Mu Kui's grave, Ade Ake couldn't help thinking,
Final07_16	The visitor from heaven who fought with us,
Final07_17	And where is he now?
Final07_18	We may never see each other again, but the journey we have been on together,
Final07_19	Ade Ake has not forgotten.
Final08_00	The song ends with Sonja.
Final08_01	The world rises and falls, but the Pavilion of Beauty and Dreams always manages to float between the various forces,
Final08_02	Fan Xiangdie carried her sisters through time and time again through difficulties and covetousness,
Final08_03	and with the financial support of Su Qingrui,
Final08_04	Further expanding the scope of intelligence to the whole of Saicheon.
Final08_05	Su Qingrui, after the Jing Tairan incident,
Final08_06	Reviving the Su House after a long and painful hiatus,
Final08_07	and to gather together the wise and the talented to manage their forces,
Final08_08	Relying on the intelligence network of the Pretty Dream Pavilion,
Final08_09	Mobilization of men and horses in support of the righteousness of the parties in Sichon,
Final08_10	At last it became a matter of mention in Jianghu,
Final08_11	Then everyone gave the thumbs up and shouted for the little Mon-tan and the great warrior Su.
Final09_00	Moving like a merchant.
Final09_01	After the tragedy at the Fuxian Academy, the collection of books in the academy were destroyed,
Final09_02	Countless precious martial arts secrets have been lost.
Final09_03	But without the secret provocation of the Imperial Guard,
Final09_04	At last, the bloodshed in the world of Jianghu is a bit less.
Final09_05	A few months later, a mysterious swordswoman was born,
Final09_06	This swordswoman walks alone, all the way north,
Final09_07	No one in the world can match her skill with a sword.
Final09_08	Whenever asked about the purpose of her journey,
Final09_09	She just laughed and didn't say anything.
Final09_10	But just as she was reaching the pinnacle of fame ..,
Final09_11	She disappeared beyond the Great Wall, never to be seen again.
Final09_12	Decades later, the name is still heard in the jianghu as if born like a meteor,
Final09_13	The story of the swordswoman who also disappeared like a meteor.
Final09_14	Looking out over the vast meadow where her mother was born,
Final09_15	Yan Yushu has finally fulfilled a wish of her heart.
Final09_16	Next, she wanted to see the world,
Final09_17	Somewhere, perhaps, there will be another door to the Holy Temple,
Final09_18	able to lead to the place where he is.
Final10_00	The moon is setting and the stars are sinking
Final10_01	After the storm over the Book of Heaven ,
Final10_02	Yan Yushu and Dongfang Chi quietly left the Fuxian Academy.
Final10_03	Emperor Zhu Yuan Juan had sent his men to search for them, but they always found nothing.
Final10_04	A few months later, a mysterious swordswoman was born,
Final10_05	This swordswoman walked alone, heading north,
Final10_06	With a sword that is unparalleled in the world.
Final10_07	Whenever asked about the purpose of her journey,
Final10_08	She just laughed and didn't say anything.
Final10_09	But just as she was reaching the pinnacle of fame ..,
Final10_10	She disappeared beyond the Great Wall, never to be seen again.
Final10_11	Decades later, rumors still circulated that the name was born like a meteor,
Final10_12	The story of the swordswoman who also disappeared like a meteor.
Final10_13	Looking out over the vast meadow where her mother was born,
Final10_14	Yan Yushu has finally fulfilled a wish of her heart.
Final10_15	Now, there is only one thought left in her mind.
Final10_16	In the next life, will there be a day to meet again?
Final11_00	Leaning on the saddle, thinking of the steed
Final11_01	He Yuqing blamed herself for He Hongyuan's death,
Final11_02	And so she has put away her old rude ways,
Final11_03	Leading the He Family horses,
Final11_04	Over and over again, they have fought against the encroachment of poor mountains and mountain bandits.
Final11_05	Although the He Family Horse Gang is not the greatest anymore,
Final11_06	But He Yuqing with her superb swordsmanship and toughness of character,
Final11_07	Remains the most revered Horse Potter in the Tiannan martial arts world.
Final11_08	He Yuqing has always regarded it as her duty to protect the He Family Horse Gang,
Final11_09	Yet the older gangs used to say this from time to time,
Final11_10	"Ayu is not the same Ayu anymore.
Final11_11	The young gangster never knew what that meant ,
Final11_12	Perhaps even He Yuqing herself didn't know.
Final11_13	Her deep eyes shone with loneliness ,
Final11_14	Because the responsibility is too heavy on their shoulders? Guilt over your father's death?
Final11_15	Or perhaps, deep down, there were other desires hidden in her heart?
Final12_00	Shadow of the Day by Day
Final12_01	Huang Shang did his best,
Final12_02	And still it was not possible to stop the guest of God who had let the scourge go,
Final12_03	He could only watch as he entered the gates of the Temple,
Final12_04	Disappears into the void.
Final12_05	Rehabilitate yourself? Atonement?
Final12_06	The hypocritical words that were spewed out in that arrogant, chivalrous heavenly visitor,
Final12_07	While trampling on the dignity of his dead wife and children,
Final12_08	And he became one of Huang Shang's enemies.
Final12_09	Day after day, year after year,
Final12_10	No matter how hard the He Luo clan tried to persuade him, he never softened in the slightest,
Final12_11	He killed all the remnants of the NoMercy House,
Final12_12	Set out in pursuit of the Holy Temple, which has long since been moved from its place of manifestation.
Final12_13	Wherever the visitor from heaven has fled,
Final12_14	For the grievances of his dead wife and children,
Final12_15	And for the fire of his unquenchable vengeance,
Final12_16	As long as he lives,
Final12_17	It will be as quick as a shadow, after killing.
Final13_00	cure the world of diseases
Final13_01	Cheng Yanhua and Du Jinpeng are no longer in love,
Final13_02	With her daughter, she hid herself in a hut of flowers,
Final13_03	Help Chen Zhiji heal the poor.
Final13_04	Not willing to make any more waves,
Final13_05	Thus the external affairs were left to the sole responsibility of Chen Zhiji,
Final13_06	As time passes, the name of Lady Cheng fades from the world's attention.
Final13_07	Yuzhi is smart and studious, and learns the art of medicine and poisoning from Chen Zhiji,
Final13_08	Having ten per cent more understanding than his mother,
Final13_09	and succeeded Chen Zhiji after his death,
Final13_10	Become the new generation of Medicine King's successor.
Final13_11	After this battle, Shi Hongtu temporarily disappeared from the world,
Final13_12	Wait for the right time to do it again.
Final14_00	Spicy hand, poisonous heart.
Final14_01	In the end, Cheng Yanhua was killed by Feng Qiuxiang's secret plan.
Final14_02	Du Jinpeng's grief and hatred are unbearable, but he does not dare to say anything,
Final14_03	Take out his anger on the Tibetan Herb Shed.
Final14_04	Shi Hongtu has never been able to find the Pill King Divine Chapter,
Final14_05	The poison king's name is now known as the Poison King as his temperament becomes more violent.
Final14_06	However, after the death of his mother, Du Yuzhi inherited the Pill King's Divine Chapter,
Final14_07	endured two years of humiliation, and finally poisoned and killed the entire Du family.
Final14_08	Ten years later,
Final14_09	In the place of the former Tibetan flower and straw shed a small field of flowers was added,
Final14_10	The name of the Medicine King rises again.
Final15_00	Recreating the Heavenly Family
Final15_01	Looking back, Situ Jing had a rough life,
Final15_02	He was oppressed when he entered the palace at an early age,
Final15_03	After being expelled from the palace, he was despised for being a eunuch.
Final15_04	He practices poisonous kung fu, and spends all his time thinking about revenge, resenting that he has no peace.
Final15_05	After the winery's assault,
Final15_06	After a bitter recollection, he leaves Rongxiu at the winery and leaves.
Final15_07	Master Chen, the richest man in his life, saw Rongxiu's intelligence and kindness,
Final15_08	After understanding that her grandson, Chan Chi Kee, has no intention to inherit the winery as he wants to travel around the world,
Final15_09	Passing on all the skills of brewing to Rong Xiu,
Final15_10	And on the day of his death, he made it a rule that the estate should be passed on to his wise men and not to his family,
Final15_11	Breaking the rule that the wealth of a lifetime should be held by the sons of Chen,
Final15_12	Passing the estate to Yan Rongxiu to inherit.
Final15_13	When Rongxiu became an adult, he searched several times,
Final15_14	Finally found the hidden Situ Jing,
Final15_15	To take them to the outskirts of the estate and settle them there,
Final15_16	And to be at peace every day, and to be filial to your side, and to enjoy your days.
Final16_00	Never to return.
Final16_01	Situ Jing wandered the world with Yan Rongxiu,
Final16_02	And he passed on all his evil martial arts skills to Rong Xiu,
Final16_03	The assassins who were involved in the killing of Yan Baochuan were found one by one,
Final16_04	And use the Corpse Snake Poison Blood Kung Fu to kill.
Final16_05	Yan Rongxiu became a master of the evil ways,
Final16_06	Burning, killing, and looting, everyone in the triads is horrified by the news.
Final16_07	Looking back, Situ Jing had a rough life,
Final16_08	He was oppressed at an early age when he entered the palace, and then humiliated as a eunuch when he was expelled from the palace,
Final16_09	Having learned the evil sect's kung fu, he is always thinking of revenge,
Final16_10	Hate that no day of peace,
Final16_11	In the eagerness of youth to practice,
Final16_12	And the practice of the serpent's venomous blood Kung Fu through unorthodox means,
Final16_13	Ultimately, his power was reversed and he died with a festering internal organ,
Final16_14	After groaning seventy-seven and forty-nine days,
Final16_15	The gas was cut off from a house in a back alley in Xichuan.
Final17_00	Dao Danxin.
Final17_01	Under the turmoil caused by Zhan Yinfei,
Final17_02	Wang Zhe saw righteous brother Li Yanxian, righteous sister Bailu Shuang
Final17_03	They both died in order to stop the NoMercy House.
Final17_04	In the midst of his grief, he resolved to carry on his brother's legacy,
Final17_05	A lifetime of defending the country from foreign invasion.
Final17_06	After ascending to the top of Qingtian, Wang Zhe took over the position of the stronghold,
Final17_07	Leading the Qingtian Fortress against the Wolf Barbarians.

Final17_10	In every encounter, the pure yangzi will be there to give guidance,
Final17_11	Guide Wang Zhe to understand the profound meaning of Taoism in "Tai Qing Di Gang Qi",
Final17_12	Wang Zhe is highly qualified in both martial arts and Taoism,
Final17_13	Although he is concerned about the affairs of his country, and has devoted himself to the army, when he is nearing the end of his life,
Final17_14	He is still able to comprehend the most profound knowledge of the "Tai Qing Gang Qi",
Final17_15	A few years later, he founded the Jeonjin sect, creating an unparalleled martial art,
Final17_16	Known to the world as "Chrysostom".
Final17_17	However, every time he hears of an invading enemy,
Final17_18	Wang Zhe always remembered the words of his elder brother before his death,

Final18_00	Stop clouds and Set the moon
Final18_01	At the end of the treacherous adventure in Shu,
Final18_02	Zhang Junbao waved goodbye to two friends in succession,
Final18_03	Once again, he set out on a journey to travel the world.
Final18_04	The three who swore they would meet again have been separated from each other ever since.
Final18_05	Thirty years ago, an epidemic broke out in Shuzhong,
Final18_06	Zhang Sanfeng drove all the way from the Middle Kingdom to Xichuan,
Final18_07	Just in time to see his old friend one last time.
Final18_08	Now that he is nearly a hundred years old, he has attained a state of pure inner strength,
Final18_09	But in recent years, there has been a gradual loss of strength.
Final18_10	That night, Zhang Sanfeng sat alone in his room, and suddenly felt something,
Final18_11	Look out towards the temple where the sky visitor left.
Final18_12	"If you don't come, this old friend won't be waiting for you.
Final19_00	dark spirits of the underworld
Final19_01	Ever since that day when she slew that man in that nameless valley,
Final19_02	A thorn in the heart of the Hundred-Loss Daoist Goddess｜
Final19_03	She did not hear the sound of the man on the ground.
Final19_04	Several nights, she felt as if she were back at the edge of the valley,
Final19_05	Watching that cheerful, obnoxious face disappear from view.
Final19_06	But no matter how attentive and careful she was ,
Final19_07	She still could not hear the coveted, beautiful sound of the crash.
Final19_08	Only the sound of the wind whistling in the dry valley mocked her, dumbly.
Final19_09	In order to remove the thorn in her heart, she had been practicing her martial arts for years,
Final19_10	Raised the martial arts of the master to a realm unimaginable by his predecessors.
Final19_11	The two new apprentices were avidly meeting and patting horses ,
Final19_12	But she herself knew that the man was a true martial arts genius,
Final19_13	She would not outlast him one day.
Final19_14	The wind in her ears had become clearer lately, and it was clearly his voice.
Final19_15	"I will come to you.
Final20_00	Magpie Starlight.
Final20_01	That day she made a desperate leap in the Holy of Holies,
Final20_02	Changed your life forever.
Final20_03	Finally it's your turn too ,
Final20_04	What it's like to have your ordinary life messed up by an outsider.
Final20_05	A woman from a different world with no identity, where every day is an adventure.
Final20_06	A missing person who returns to reality, never to live an ordinary life again.
Final20_07	Nonetheless, she is the only proof of your otherworldly adventure,
Final20_08	Through the strange days of the sword,
Final20_09	The world of martial arts has long since become another homeland for you.
Final20_10	Whenever you think of those unforgettable moments...,
Final20_11	Or misses someone who was once with her in life and in death.
Final20_12	She thought the telephone and the computer were some kind of magic spell,
Final20_13	It became the only person you could talk to at will.
Final20_14	Every morning, when you hear her scream again,
Final20_15	With the noise of some electrical appliance going out of control,
Final20_16	And you know, the skywalker story isn't over yet.
Final21_00	A natural talent
Final21_01	And you led him out of the village of Arches,
Final21_02	Through the adventures along the way, it reveals the heartfelt side of Jianghu.
Final21_03	Look at your energetic smile,
Final21_04	Luo Yuanyu secretly made up his mind ,
Final21_05	To be a man like you.
Final21_06	He who is good at dealing with people ,
Final21_07	A group of seemingly useless beggars quickly gathered,
Final21_08	Start his own business based in a beggar's dwelling.
Final22_00	The hare is dead and the dog is cooked.
Final22_01	You took him out of Gongshi Village, by going on an adventure,
Final22_02	And he grew, and grew strong.
Final22_03	But he who had fought with you for many years, and thought he had achieved fame,
Final22_04	In the end, you, who do not want to share power, turned against him and killed him mercilessly.
Final22_05	His motto in life is to be ruthless and merciless, and to change the times.
Final22_06	He was good at dealing with people, and soon made a comeback,
Final22_07	Gathered a group of seemingly useless beggars,
Final22_08	Start his own business based in a beggar's dwelling.
Final23_00	Warm words gazing into eyes
Final23_01	I would have stayed at the gate of Taiwah all my life,
Final23_02	Not understanding the world outside,
Final23_03	Not knowing the story of the grandparents,
Final23_04	Do not know｜You,
Final23_05	But it is good that we have met.
Final23_06	Thank you, brother, I will be good.
Final23_07	You too,｜.
Final24_00	River and Mountain Beauty.
Final24_01	A red face? A dumping ground?
Final24_02	In the face of the advances of your subordinates against you,
Final24_03	You laughed it off, unashamedly,
Final24_04	Take the smiling beauty beside you in your arms.
Final24_05	In complete control of the world, you recall that moment,
Final24_06	They who chose to stand by you at that time,
Final24_07	Thirsting for long-term belonging and dependence,
Final24_08	That's another way to stay on the right path,
Final24_09	A single-minded desire to go home to what you cannot give.
Final24_10	So you make the decision that you will satisfy them,
Final24_11	Give them a future where they are no longer alone.
Final24_12	But to-day,
Final24_13	And what is their true place in your heart?
Final24_14	Ask yourself, you've finally understood,
Final24_15	They are, after all, only an amusement to your noble status,
Final24_16	Companionship, favour,
Final24_17	That is all grace from you as Sovereign,
Final24_18	Your companion is never a beauty,
Final24_19	It's the picturesque mountains, the supreme power.
